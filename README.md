##  Introduction

This project was developed as part of the EEE 416 Microprocessor and Embedded System Laboratory course at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).This IoT-based real-time patient monitoring system measures temperature, pressure, humidity, gas levels, heart rate, and oxygen saturation using multiple sensors.


##  Key Features

- **Real-Time Environmental Monitoring**: Tracks Humidity and Temperature of the environment in patient's surroindings
- **Pulse Rate Monitoring**: Continuously measures the patient's heart rate, offering critical data for assessing cardiovascular health.
- **Body Temperature Monitoring**: Provides real-time tracking of the patientâ€™s body temperature, enabling the detection of fever or other health issues.
- **Oxygen Saturation Monitoring**: Measures the oxygen levels in the patient's blood, a vital parameter for assessing respiratory and overall health.

### Design Analysis and Evaluation

Several novel features were added to enhance the system. It enables mobile real-time monitoring of patient vitals, sends automatic SOS alerts to doctors when thresholds are exceeded, operates without an external Wi-Fi module, and uses an LED-buzzer for instant environmental alerts.

### Future Work

The future works and prospects of the IoT-based health monitoring system project are promising, with potential avenues for further development and expansion. Some key areas for future exploration include:
1.	Enhanced Sensor Integration:
    -	Explore the integration of additional sensors and health monitoring devices to broaden the scope of monitored parameters, providing a more comprehensive health profile for patients.
2.	Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics:
    -	Implement machine learning algorithms and predictive analytics to analyze historical health data. This can enable the system to anticipate potential health issues and proactively suggest interventions.
3.	Telemedicine Integration:
    -	Integrate telemedicine functionalities to facilitate remote consultations between healthcare providers and patients, fostering a more holistic approach to virtual healthcare.
